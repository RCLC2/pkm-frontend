This is your digital knowledge management system that combines the power of **Zettelkasten** methodology with the **CODE/PARA** organizational system.

## What is Zettelkasten?

Zettelkasten (German for "slip box") is a method of knowledge management that emphasizes:

- **Atomic notes**: Each note contains one idea
- **Linking**: Notes are connected through meaningful relationships
- **Emergence**: New insights emerge from the network of connected ideas

## CODE/PARA System

Your notes are organized using the CODE/PARA method:

- **Projects**: Things with deadlines and specific outcomes
- **Areas**: Ongoing responsibilities to maintain
- **Resources**: Topics of ongoing interest
- **Archive**: Inactive items from the other categories

## Getting Started

1. Create atomic notes with single concepts
2. Use [[double brackets]] to link to other notes
3. Add #tags to categorize your thoughts
4. Let your knowledge graph grow organically
